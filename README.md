# cancer

## Background

The goal of this project is to simulate how healthy cells mutate and how the resulting cancer cells spread and respond to different conditions. The end product will accept inputs from oncologists, or anyone who knows what they're doing, and produce a detailed report after running simulations. Theoritically, by running billions, or even trillions of simuations, we could stumble upon a universal treatment. This sounds like an overly ambitious goal coming from a software developer who knows almost nothing about cancer. But that's exactly what makes it intersting.

This project is part of a larger goal to map the entire human body cell by cell. Anyone with relevant expertise is allowed to contribute to the project. Medical experts, especially are encouraged to contribute (Desperately needed actually).

## Implementation

The initital plan is to map all cell properties relevant to cancer. Object Oriented Programming will play a big role in doing this.

We will also have external factors as objects with certain properies. For example, radition.

### Questions we could initially need answers to?

    How are cell properties affected by external factors?
    
    How much radiation is enough to cause mutation in cells, leading to cancer?
    
    Other than radition, what other things cause corruption of the cell's instruction set?
    
    What happens when a certain treatment is applied to a patient with cancer?




### Current Knowledge gaps

Please feel free to contribute if you are an expert in any of the following:

    Oncology in general

    Mathematical oncology
    
    Mathematical modelling:
    
        Calculus -> Advanced concepts like nullclines
        
        Sensitivity analysis
        
        Uncertainty analysis

### Existing Research and resources

No projects have accompished what we aim to. None has even come close. However, there have been significan't contributions that may aid in this research:
